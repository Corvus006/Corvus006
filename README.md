I'm a student at the [Willibald-Gluck-Gymnasium](https://www.wgg-neumarkt.de/) in Germany and a member of its [Robotics Team](https://github.com/wggRobotic/), where I contribute to software development using **Python**, **C++**, and **ROS 2**.

### ü§ñ Current Focus

I'm currently working on our quadruped robot **Idefix**, with the goal of getting it to walk. I'm especially fascinated by the challenges involved in motion planning, control, and robotics software architecture.

### üõ† Side Projects

When I'm not working on robotics, I enjoy experimenting with various projects:

- üí¨ A small spam program written in **Java** ‚Äì my first real personal project: [AutoTyper](https://github.com/Corvus006/AutoTyper)
- üéÆ A mobile app for the currently hyped **Impostor game**, built using **Flutter**: [imposter_game](https://github.com/Corvus006/imposter_game)
- üñ•Ô∏è A **Kubernetes-based server cluster** I built with friends ([Ilian](https://github.com/IliHanSoLow), [Felix](https://github.com/Scriptor25)) using repurposed school computers: [jiflabs.de](https://jiflabs.de/)

### üí° Interests

- Linux, Docker, and DevOps tools  
- Programming languages: C++, Python, Rust
